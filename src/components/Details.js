          <h1>Why Plants are Important?</h1>
          <p>A plant is beneficial in many ways. Plants add to the healthfulness of the environment by cooling and purifying the air. Besides cutting off the direct and reflected rays of the sun, foliage exercises a marked effect on the temperature by evaporating large quantities of water from its surface. A plant also absorbs impure and hurtful gases and sets free the oxygen that we, humans, and animals need for respiration. Vegetation adds materially to the comforts of our life, and yes, it also gives pleasure! A life without plants, flowers, and trees will not only be hard on our precious little blue planet, it will be impossible... With this website we like to guide you through the breathtaking beauty and purity of mother nature. You will find an enormous amount of information about hundreds of plant varieties together with detailed information.</p>
